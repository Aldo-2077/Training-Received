## Advanced Incident Response and Threat Hunting

**Overview**

Attacks are a major concern in cybersecurity and it is essential to have a solid understanding of them in order to detect and prevent them effectively. During my training, I began by studying common attacker techniques and familiarizing myself with the characteristics of malware and other types of attacks. I also delved deeper into the methods that adversaries use to establish persistence in a network.

Persistence is a critical aspect of an attack and it is usually established early on. I learned how to hunt for potential threats in a network and identify them quickly. I also received practice in identifying and dealing with specific types of attacks such as those that use "living off the land" binaries, PowerShell, and WMI. These have become common methods used by advanced adversaries and it is important to be able to detect them at scale.

Finally, this section ended with a comprehensive discussion of Microsoft credentials, which are a major vulnerability in modern networks. Credentials are a prime target for attackers and I learned how to prevent, detect, and mitigate attacks on them. The complexity of credentials in the modern enterprise cannot be overstated and understanding the tools and techniques being used to target them is crucial to securing a network.

### **Topics**

**Real Incident Response Tactics**

- Preparation: Key tools, techniques, and procedures that an incident response team needs to respond properly to intrusions

- Identification/Scoping: Proper scoping of an incident and detecting all compromised systems in the enterprise

- Containment/Intelligence Development: Restricting access, monitoring, and learning about the adversary in order to develop threat intelligence

- Eradication/Remediation: Determining and executing key steps that must be taken to help stop the current incident and the move to real-time remediation

- Recovery: Recording of the threat intelligence to be used in the event of a similar adversary returning to the enterprise

- Avoiding "Whack-A-Mole" Incident Response: Going beyond immediate eradication without proper incident scoping/containment

**Threat Hunting**

- Hunting versus Reactive Response
- Intelligence-Driven Incident Response
- Building a Continuous Incident Response/Threat Hunting Capability
- Forensic Analysis versus Threat Hunting Across Endpoints
- Threat Hunt Team Roles
- ATT&CK - MITRE's Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK(TM))
